# Schema:
# servers: a list of managed hosts with connection info
#   - name: unique hostname or id
#     ip: IP or resolvable address
#     port: SSH port (optional, default 22)
#     ssh_user: user to connect as (optional, default 'root')
#     ssh_auth: connection method (one of 'private_key' or 'password')
#       private_key: path to private key on controller (when type is 'private_key')
#       password: SSH password (when type is 'password')
#
# Examples below show both supported connection methods. Choose one per server.

servers:
  - name: db-01
    ip: 10.0.3.6
    port: 22
    timeout: 300
    ssh_user: ubuntu
    # Optional: specify the python interpreter on the remote host to avoid
    # interpreter discovery warnings (default used by playbook is /usr/bin/python3)
    # python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
    # Use a private key that exists on the control machine (recommended)
    ssh_auth:
      type: private_key
      # Provide a path to the private key on the controller (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
      private_key: /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa

  - name: lxc-host-01
    ip: 10.0.3.10
    port: 22
    timeout: 300
    ssh_user: ubuntu
    # This host is an example LXC manager node used to run `lxc exec` commands
    # to update containers. Adjust values and credentials as needed.
    ssh_auth:
      type: private_key
      # private_key: /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa

  # Example using password authentication (less secure)
  #- name: vm-02
  #  ip: 10.0.3.7
  #  ssh_user: root
  #  ssh_auth:
  #    type: password
  #    password: "s3cretP@ssw0rd"

# - Copy this file to vars/secrets.yml and fill in real values before running.
